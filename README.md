# flashData
Every line of code 
I get exposed to
is special, for that
they remains in the immutable storage 
of my brain. 

unlike a disk drive, 
it is utmoast scalable,
It burn a significant amount of energy,
just for the the L1 cache 
of my brain,
which  is also immutable but
limited for each exclusive index.

as I do all this myself 
subconsciously
whenever I feel the memory of a codesic,
be that a discontinued firmware, 
a misceliounes library
a CSS trick that I learened in the early days
it takes the energy again to propagate the 
generation of the memory

somtimes (mostly roughly 80%) it elnds rEGenerating the wheel

so this flashData

a bridge to my immutable Raid Storage array with my atomic L1 cache
of my brain.

P.S. this repository is of my brain, by my brain, and fom my brain
